**Tic Tac Toe Game**
Hereâ€™s a brief summary of what I done

1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game Creation
   Started by working on a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,I built a fully functioning game with a game board with user interactivity.

2. Improved Game Features
   I added a red linear background and a new game button that resets the game. I also wanted to display a win or draw message when the game ends.

3. Debugging the Game
   I encountered an issue where the "X" and "O" marks were not showing when clicking the board. I fixed that by modifying the JavaScript to add both the classes and text content for proper display.

4. Local Running Issues
   I was trying to run the game locally on my MacBook using a text editor but faced problems where the HTML code was showing as raw text in the browser. I had to save the file as `.html`, switching from my TextEdit to plain text mode, and using proper code editors like Visual Studio Code to make sure the files run correctly.
